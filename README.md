# PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) Project - 5th Semester Mini Project

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with a focus on simplicity and clarity, built as part of my mini project for the 5th semester. The project is a refined version of a similar project I came across at [kschutz68/PLL_PD_PN](https://github.com/kschutz68/PLL_PD_PN).

### Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a simple yet well-documented and easy-to-understand implementation of a Phase-Locked Loop. The implementation was developed in multiple drafts:

1. **1st Draft (Original Concept)**:  
   This version was based largely on the information from the [kschutz68/PLL_PD_PN](https://github.com/kschutz68/PLL_PD_PN) repository. It contained a combination of both MATLAB code and Simulink blocks. Due to the complexity of integrating MATLAB and Simulink, it was difficult to work through the code.

2. **2nd Draft (MATLAB + Simulink Refined)**:  
   In an attempt to simplify the project, I tried to either embed Simulink within the MATLAB code or make the entire project MATLAB-based, but faced some challenges in streamlining the process.

3. **3rd Draft (MATLAB-Only Solution)**:  
   I decided to stick to MATLAB entirely and removed all Simulink dependencies. This version was easier to handle and focused on pure MATLAB scripting, leading to a cleaner and more manageable project.

4. **4th Draft (Final Version)**:  
   The final draft is a refinement of the 3rd draft. It further improves on the structure, readability, and documentation, providing a simpler, more explained version of the PLL project. This version is more user-friendly and offers better explanations to help understand the inner workings of the PLL.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the original [kschutz68/PLL_PD_PN](https://github.com/kschutz68/PLL_PD_PN) project for providing the initial concept and inspiration for this mini project. Although my code is simpler and more explained, the original project served as a foundational reference.

### Project Structure

The repository contains the following drafts:
- **Draft1**: Initial version with MATLAB and Simulink integration.
- **Draft2**: Refinement with either MATLAB embedded Simulink or partial MATLAB replacement.
- **Draft3**: Fully MATLAB-based PLL implementation.
- **Draft4**: Final version with improved readability and documentation.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the respective draft folder.
3. Open the MATLAB script (e.g., `pll.m`).
4. Run the script in MATLAB environment.

Ensure you have a MATLAB version compatible with the code provided. No external dependencies are required.
